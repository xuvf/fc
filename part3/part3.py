"""
This module represents some classes for a simple word game.

There are a number of incomplete methods in the which you must implement to make fully functional.

About the game board!
The board's tiles are indexed from 1 to N, and the first square (1,1) is in the top left.
A tile may be replaced by another tile, hence only one tile may occupy a space at any one time.
